# Rules for working with and updating design documents

1. When working on design documents come up with analysis summary first, update documents only after asked to do so
2. Keep the changes limited to only the topic discussed, do not updated irrelevant files or sections
3. Keep the changes concise and to the point, avoid bloating of the documents.
4. Don't recreate sections that were manually removed or changed by the user at previous steps.
