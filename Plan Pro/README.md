# Plan Pro

This folder is the rewritten, implementation-ready source of truth.

## Start Here
- Read `working_protocol.md` first (how to work).
- Read `implementation_master.md` first.
- Use linked files only for deep detail in that specific domain.
- Do not copy text between files. Link instead.

## Ownership Rule
- Every file starts with `Owns` and `Excludes`.
- If new content does not fit an existing owner, create one new file owner and register it in `00_navigation/document_registry.md`.

## Status
- The old `Plan/` folder is input material.
- `Plan Pro/` is the execution plan used for build and launch.
