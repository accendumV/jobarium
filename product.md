1. How to mitigate the frustration of "I've set everything up and no one contacted me, what can I do to expedite?"
   - Solution: a system of suggestions to the candidate what to improve (in skills and/or not profile). Has to be honest improvement if in profile. See the next point. 
2. What are the levers of ensuring the authenticity of the profile?
   - Solution: penalties for receiving too many rejection in late stage.
   - Important: IMO the initial screening/matching situation came into total distrust. The system, ideally, should try to solve the problem on fundamental level instead of just moving the issue up in the abstraction levels.  
3. While the smart (AI) match and automation do eliminate a lot of informational noise they also eliminate potential uniqueness of candidate's resume. While it might be not a problem for senior candidates, it might be a problem for entry level ones.
   - Focus point: avoid falling into characterless workflow where uniqueness of candidates is hidden, not taken into account, transforms into just a "mark".  
4. R-11: Candidate Experience Quality. IMO mobile-friendly aspect and quick time to accomplish are overvalued. This is not something a candidate does on a daily basis and expect minimum time to spend. Trust into the system is more important.
   - Solution: offer multi-step profile creation, from basics to (eventually in implementation as well as candidate's workflow) comprehensive questionnairy/screening. 
5. Persona X: entry-level candidate looking for the first or second job. Might be an oversight not to consider those. Young talents are very "noisy" field but it's where really great benefits might come from as hiring truly perspective young professional is a huge asset. Such young people can also be better early adopters of the system.
   - Suggestion: brainstorm more about what the solution can offer them.
